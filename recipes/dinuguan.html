    <p>Dinuguan, also known as chocolate meat, is a savory dish made with diced pork, pork blood, and spices. This classic Filipino pork stew is hearty, boldly flavored, and delicious as a main meal with steamed rice or a midday snack with puto.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>10 ounces</strong> pork blood</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> canola oil</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> onion, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li><strong>4 cloves</strong> garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> thumb-size ginger (about 1 Tbsp), peeled and minced</li>
        <li><strong>2 pounds</strong> pork belly, cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> fish sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup</strong> water</li>
